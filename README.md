# Nick Almond's Landing Page

## Motivation

This project exists because Nick Almond wanted a place for potential employers and professors to easily contact him and view his projects more easily.

## Description

Nick Almond's Landing Page was created as a mini project for a coding boot-camp and contains Nick Almonds' Github link, a "Contact Me" form, and Portfolio link.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this site, click on "Github" to be directed to Nick Almond's Github profile, click "Contact" to be directed to the "Contact Me" form or fill out the form directly at the bottom of the screen. The "Portfolio" link is empty and is coming soon once a portfolio has been created.
